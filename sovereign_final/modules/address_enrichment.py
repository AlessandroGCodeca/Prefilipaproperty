"""
modules/address_enrichment.py — wire normalize_address into the pipeline.

Some listings arrive with a messy or partial address_raw but a blank district
(JSON-LD without locality, premium listings, odd slug forms). A blank district
makes engine.financial.get_rent_estimate fall through to the €6.50/m² default
rate, which understates rent for anything in a real city — distorting the
cashflow and deal scores.

This runs the Claude-powered normalize_address() helper (modules/llm_enrichment)
on those listings and writes back a district the rent matcher can resolve.

Degrades gracefully: a no-op returning 0 when no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set.
addr_normalized is only set once normalize_address returns (so a definitive
"can't determine" isn't retried), while transient call failures (None) are left
to retry on the next run, bounded by `limit`.
